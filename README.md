# Professional Scientific Calculator

A robust and visually stunning scientific calculator built with **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS**.

Unlike traditional web simple calculators, this project features a **Horizontal Wide-Screen Layout** optimized for desktop productivity, a premium **Glassmorphism** design with animated backgrounds, and a dedicated **History Side-Panel**. 

It runs entirely in the browser (Static Site), making it incredibly fast and easy to deploy.

## ✨ Features

- **Advanced UI/UX**: Premium Glassmorphism design with animated backgrounds and neon accents.
- **Scientific Functions**: Support for Trigonometry (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), Logarithms (`log`, `ln`), Powers (`^`), Roots (`√`), and Constants (`π`).
- **Mode Switching**: Toggle between **Degree (DEG)** and **Radian (RAD)** modes for trigonometric calculations.
- **Calculation History**: interactive history list saved to **Local Storage**—click any past calculation to reuse it.
- **Keyboard Support**: Type numbers naturally and press `Enter` to calculate.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running Locally

Since this is a static website, you can simply open the file in your browser.

1.  **Clone or Download** the repository.
2.  **Open** the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

Alternatively, if you are using VS Code, you can use the "Live Server" extension for a better experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Animations, Glassmorphism), JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: Browser Local Storage (for history)
- **Design Font**: 'Outfit' and 'JetBrains Mono'.

## 📝 Usage Tips

- **Trigonometry**: By default, the calculator is in **DEG** mode (e.g., `sin(90) = 1`). Click the "DEG" button to switch to **RAD** (Radians).
- **History**: Click the trash icon to clear your calculation history.
- **Power**: Use `^` for exponents (e.g., `2^3`).
